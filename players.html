            <p id="playerinfo">
                Playing as the second line center for the Colarado Avalanche last season, kadri was able to elevate his team with his play,
                resulting in them winning the stanley cup. He was able to use physical play to get under the skin of opposing teams while 
                also driving to the net to produce goals and plays for his team. With Kadri coming into the flames organisation, they finally
                filled the role of an elite second line center, while making up one of the deepest center groups in the NHL.

            <p id="playerinfo">
                While Johnny Gaudreau leaving the flames this offseason hurt them a lot, with the new aquisition of Jonathan Huberdeau
                they were able to replace Gaudreau entirely. Despite them having different styles of play, both the top line left wingers
                produced 115 points last season making them tied for second in the league. Huberdeau also provides the leadership that he
                gave the Florida Panthers over his time there, which Gaudreau failed to do.

            <p id="playerinfo">
                Mackenzie Weegar was one of the Florida Panthers best defenceman playing on the first pairing. He's great at making transitions
                through the rush, bringing the puck up, and setting up plays. He plays a great 2 way game and gives the flames some extra fire 
                power from the blueline. With this addition and the defenceman the flames already have, they now have one of the deepest bluelines 
                and arguably the best defensive group in the league.
